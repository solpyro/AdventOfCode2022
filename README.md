# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm going to try creating graphical outputs for each puzzle, using [Processing](https://processing.org/) while I earn my ⭐s.

## Day 1: Calorie Counting ⭐⭐

An easy start, but I#m already reminded how clunky Processing and Java are as languages. To be fair, I had over-engineered the Elf class in part 1, thinking that I'd need the seperate values in part 2. In the end I could have just collapsed the values into a single calorie count per elf, and used a normal array, which would have been much less work.

## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ⭐⭐

This time I tried to keep things simple, to the point that I just coded a switch-case with the possible outcomes for the RPS game.
